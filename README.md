## Pricing Page

The pricing page consist of various subscription according to yearly,monthly and teams and the payment module changes according to that, as if you choose the indivisiual pricing it will show the pricing for that and same for others packages, the pricing page is also the signup part for the frontend master as without paying up the price you can only access the preview part of the courses.
We create the api for the Pricing Page so that after user fill their basic details their data is posted to our mongo sever, so that we can fetch and validate their data at the time of login process.
